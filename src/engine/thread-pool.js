/**
 * ThreadPool - Object pool for Thread objects.
 * Reduces GC pressure by reusing Thread instances instead of creating new ones.
 *
 * Threads are one of the most frequently allocated objects in the VM:
 * - Each script execution creates a new Thread
 * - Clone creation/destruction creates/destroys Threads
 * - Broadcast events can create hundreds of Threads in a single frame
 *
 * Pool strategy:
 * - Free list: reused Threads are stored in an array
 * - Max size: prevents unbounded memory growth
 * - Auto-reset: threads are fully reset before reuse
 * - Thread pools are per-Runtime instance
